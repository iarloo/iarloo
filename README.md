&nbsp;

"When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king.

&nbsp;
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight.

&nbsp;
And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring.

&nbsp;
There's no body to batter when your mind is your might.

&nbsp;
So when you go solo, you hold your own hand.

&nbsp;
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights.

&nbsp;
And if you know where you stand, then you know where to land.

&nbsp;
And if you fall it won't matter, cuz you'll know that you're right."
